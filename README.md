# IBM_Data_Science__Python_Project_for_Data_Science

## Project Overview

In this project, I took on the role of a Data Scientist to explore real-world inspired data. I worked through the full data workflow, including:
- Extracting and web scraping data with Beautiful Soup
- Cleaning and manipulating data with Pandas
- Visualizing data and building interactive dashboards

Completed in a Jupyter Notebook, this project helped me apply Python skills to a practical scenario and create a portfolio-ready data analysis.
